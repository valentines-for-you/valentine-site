                    Hi babe, happy valentines day, its been such a journey with
                    you and I cannot believe I have someone like you in my life.
                    <br />
                    You are so amazing, sweet, incredible, funny, wholesome and
                    did I mention hot asf? You are so stunning and gorgeous,
                    everyday looking at you brings me infinite joy and takes my
                    breath away. You are so stunning, that I will never stop
                    complimenting you nor understand how you don't see it
                    yourself. We have been together for almost 9 months at this
                    point, and it has been the greatest 9 months anyone could
                    ever ask for. You have been there for me through thick and
                    thin, when I was feeling happy, and when I was sad I know I
                    have said this a lot, but I love how considerate you are to
                    everyone especially me. Like how important it is that
                    everyone feels included and seen when you are in a group. I
                    love that about you and I cannot wait to spend the rest of
                    my life with you. I really hope that we continue to move
                    through life together, learning and building on each other,
                    tackling every problem that comes our way. I like u so much
                    from your personality, your laugh, your hair, the way you
                    smile, your beautiful brown eyes, and your nails ur always
                    biting I'm truly in love with every aspect of you Emily, and
                    I cannot even fathom spending my life with anyone else. I
                    like u so much, from every single one of your conversations,
                    to anytime I get to hold you. I'm so incredible grateful to
                    have you, and have someone so amazing to call my partner. I
                    know you have been going through so much, and doing ur best
                    to keep pushing, and I couldn't be prouder, you have made so
                    many things work always getting it done, even when the
                    pressures feel overwhelming. You are such a strong person,
                    with such a beautiful soul, I like you so much Im so proud
                    of all that you have accomplished, from getting ur first set
                    of co-op interviews, to absolutely crushing them, and from
                    your commitment to the gym, which you have been keeping up.
                    You are so perfect and sweet, and i know how much u deal
                    with personal thoughts about whether ur good enough or if
                    people find u annoying or a bother, and I can give u a
                    1000000% gaurentee that no one thinks of you that way, and
                    if they do they're stupid. As someone who has had the
                    pleasure of spending the better part of 9 months together,
                    you are no insufferable, your not annoying, your not a
                    bother, nor are u an inconvenience, not a single time has
                    those thoughts ever crossed my mind. You are so hard working
                    and always trying to o your best, and i just want u to know
                    that i see you babe, you are more than enough and you are
                    amazing everyday, anytime i get to spend with you is a
                    blessing which i can only hope keeps giving, I like you so
                    much, and i cant wait to see u during reading week <3.
