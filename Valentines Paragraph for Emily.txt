Valentines Paragraph for Emily 

Hi babe, happy valentines day, its been such a journey with you <br>and I cannot believe I have someone like you in my life. <br>
You are so amazing, sweet, incredible, funny, wholesome and did <br>I mention hot asf? You are so stunning and gorgeous, everyday <br>
looking at you brings me infinite joy and takes my breath away. <br>You are so stunning, that I will never stop complimenting you <br>
nor understand how you don't see it yourself. We have been together<br> for almost 9 months at this point, and it has been the greatest <br>
9 months anyone could ever ask for. You have been there for me through<br> thick and thin, when I was feeling happy, and when I was sad <br>
you have always been there for me, making sure I always felt loved, <br>cared for, and understood. You are such an empathetic person, and <br>
I know I have said this a lot, but I love how considerate you are to<br> everyone. Like how important it is that everyone feels included <br>
and seen when you are in a group. I love that about you and I cannot<br> wait to spend the rest of my life with you. I really hope that we <br>
continue to move through life together, learning and building on each<br> other, tackling every problem that comes our way. I like u so much <br>
form your toes up, from your personality, your laugh, your hair, the<br> way you smile, your beautiful brown eyes, and your nails ur always biting <br>
I'm truly in love with every aspect of you Emily, and I cannot even <br>fathom spending my life with anyone else. I like u so much, from every single <br>
one of your conversations, to anytime I get to hold you. I'm so incredible<br> grateful to have you, and have someone so amazing to call my partner. <br>
I know you have been going through so much, and doing ur best to keep <br>pushing, and I couldn't be prouder, you have made so many things work <br>
always getting it done, even when the pressures feel overwhelming. <br>You are such a strong person, with such a beautiful soul, I like you so much<br>
Im so proud of all that you have accomplished, from getting ur first set<br> of co-op interviews, to absolutely crushing them, and from your commitment<br>
to the gym, which you have been keeping up. You are so perfect and sweet, <br>and i know how much u deal with personal thoughts about whether ur good enough<br>
or if people find u annoying or a bother, and I can give u a 1000000% <br>gaurentee that no one thinks of you that way, and if they do they're stupid.<br>
As someone who has had the pleasure of spending the better part of 9 months<br> together, you are no insufferable, your not annoying, your not a bother, <br>
nor are u an inconvenience, not a single time has those thoughts ever <br>crossed my mind. You are so hard working and always trying to o your best, and i <br>
just want u to know that i see you babe, you are more than enough and you<br> are amazing everyday, anytime i get to spend with you is a blessing which <br>
i can only hope keeps giving, I like you so much, and i cant wait to see<br> u during reading week <3.
